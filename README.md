# Data-Mining
A python program that uses the OMDB Restful API to obtain the movie information. 
Only movies satisfying a basic filter are retrieved and exported to a csv file.

The data to be used will be collected from an API available over the internet, and then a data set will be compiled which will be primarily based on the IMDB data.
